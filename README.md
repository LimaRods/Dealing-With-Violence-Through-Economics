# Dealing-With-Violence-Through-Economics
### Hi! This project represents my contribution to a data science challenge planned by BCG Gamma and Iguarap√© institute which objective is to give a solution for the high and persistent violence in Brazil.
- We've used many data sets to apply data mining, clustering, predictive models and others advanced analytics methods in order to come up with insight to deal with and prevent violence in Brazil.
- In this following analysis, the scope will be reduced to analyze only data related to income, economy, and some of the education. It told us to focus on the homicides of people between 14 to 29 years
- P.S. Take a look at Global Inequality and Homicide Rate.ipynb to see the global correlation between homicides and inequality, it's interesting.
